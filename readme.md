# Deterministic Finite Automata
This repository consists of apython code for generating
a Deterministic Finite automata that can accept strings of the following cases
  1. Strings starting with (eg. starting with aba or aaaabbbaab etc)
  2. Atmost Number of a (eg at most only 2 a means strings with either 0 or 1 or 2 will be accepted)
  3. Atleast Number of a (eg at least only 2 a means strings with no of a >= 2 will be accepted)
  
The alphabets for this DFA are fixed and that are {a,b}
